## Limitations of Large Language Models in Essay Assessment

This assessment tool utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in analyzing academic writing. While LLMs can provide helpful insights, it is crucial to understand their limitations and use their output judiciously:

### Key Limitations

- **Pattern Recognition vs. True Understanding**
  - LLMs identify patterns in text but lack genuine comprehension of academic concepts
  - They cannot truly evaluate the accuracy or validity of scientific claims
  - Their feedback focuses on structural and stylistic elements rather than content validity

- **Training Data Constraints**
  - Models are limited by their training data cutoff dates
  - They may not reflect the most current research or academic standards
  - Their knowledge of specific scientific domains may be incomplete or outdated

- **Contextual Understanding**
  - LLMs may miss nuanced disciplinary conventions
  - They cannot fully grasp the broader academic context of arguments
  - Their understanding of field-specific terminology may be imperfect

### Guidelines for Reviewers

1. **Use as Supplementary Tool**
   - Consider AI feedback as a starting point, not definitive assessment
   - Always apply professional judgment and expertise
   - Cross-reference suggestions with established academic standards

2. **Verify Technical Content**
   - Independently verify all scientific claims and references
   - Check current literature for accuracy of technical information
   - Ensure discipline-specific conventions are properly maintained

3. **Balance Multiple Perspectives**
   - Combine AI insights with human expertise
   - Consider departmental and institutional requirements
   - Maintain focus on student learning objectives

### Best Practices

- Review AI suggestions critically before implementation
- Prioritize human judgment in final assessment decisions
- Use AI feedback to complement, not replace, traditional evaluation methods
- Consider the specific context and requirements of each assignment

Remember: This tool is designed to support, not substitute for, expert academic assessment. All recommendations should be evaluated within the appropriate academic context and standards of your field.
