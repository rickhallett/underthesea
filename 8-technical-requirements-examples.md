According to Barkley (1997) inhibition is important in ADHD. Zhang et al (2021) found emotional problems are also important. Norman, L., Hayek, L., & Pal, P. (2023) showed different networks are involved.

Behavioral inhibition plays a central role in ADHD pathophysiology (Barkley, 1997), though recent research emphasizes the importance of emotional dysregulation (Zhang et al., 2021) and altered neural network dynamics (Norman et al., 2023).

Neural networks in ADHD show different patterns of activation compared to typical brains. This affects:
* attention
* behavior
* emotion
Research shows these differences are important.

More research is needed to understand these patterns better.

Abstract

Neuroimaging research reveals distinct patterns of neural network dysfunction in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This review examines three key domains of dysfunction:

1. Attention Network Alterations
   • Disrupted fronto-parietal connectivity
   • Altered salience network function
   • Impaired attention switching mechanisms

2. Behavioral Control Networks
   • Reduced fronto-striatal activation
   • Altered inhibitory circuit function
   • Modified motor control pathways

3. Emotion Regulation Circuits
   • Changed amygdala-prefrontal connectivity
   • Disrupted emotional control networks
   • Altered reward circuit function
```

### Example 3: Inconsistent Citation Practice

#### Original Passage
```
Studies show ADHD affects brain networks (Norman et al). Other research demonstrates emotional problems (Zhang). Barkley's theory from 1997 talks about inhibition. Some authors (Castellanos and others, 2021) found developmental changes. Recent studies (in 2023) show new findings about attention.

Neuroimaging studies reveal altered brain network dynamics in ADHD (Norman et al., 2023), with particular disruption in emotional regulation circuits (Zhang et al., 2021). While Barkley (1997) emphasized inhibitory dysfunction, recent research demonstrates developmental trajectories in network organization (Castellanos et al., 2021). Contemporary investigations highlight the role of attention network dysfunction (Hou et al., 2023), suggesting a more complex neurobiological basis than previously recognized.

ADHD & Brain Function

adhd affects many brain regions. These include:
- THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX
- The Striatum
- default mode network

research shows these areas don't work properly in adhd patients (barkley, 1997).

ADHD and Neural Function

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects multiple neural systems. Key affected regions include:

1. Prefrontal Cortex
   - Executive function control
   - Attention regulation
   - Response inhibition

2. Striatum
   - Reward processing
   - Motor control
   - Learning mechanisms

3. Default Mode Network
   - Self-referential processing
   - Task-negative activity
   - Internal attention control

Research indicates dysfunction across these neural systems in individuals with ADHD (Barkley, 1997).
